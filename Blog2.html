        <p>The advent of Generative AI technologies powered by Transformers has ushered in a new era of convergence
            where previously separate categories can now be unified. This new multi-modal paradigm allows text to
            generate new text, images to generate new images, and text to generate images and so on, creating a positive
            compounding effect where advancements in one category can benefit another.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, the possibility of leveraging Exponential technology to create societal impact at scale seems more
            attainable than ever before - a sentiment I had previously expressed. What is particularly intriguing is
            that Generative AI appears to be receiving an additional, invisible impetus in the form of
            <strong>'convergence'</strong>.

        </p>
        <p>
            Historically, the AI landscape was characterized by distinct specializations including Voice, Image, Text,
            Robotics, among others. However, advancements made in one area often failed to positively influence the
            others, resulting in isolated advancements.

            The advent of Generative AI technologies powered by Transformers has ushered in a new era of convergence
            where previously separate categories can now be unified. This new
            <strong>multi-modal paradigm</strong> allows text to
            generate new text, images to generate new images, and text to generate images and so on, creating a
            <strong>positive compounding effect</strong> where advancements in one category can benefit another.

        <p>
            This <strong>convergence</strong> has produced a <strong>double-exponential impact</strong>, driven by both the Transformers and the
            combinatorial innovations from multiple AI categories.
        </p>
        <p>

            The progress we have seen is undoubtedly positive and one that we should all celebrate and embrace. However,
            it is imperative that we remain mindful of the potential downsides.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are currently witnessing a surge in unintended consequences such as biases, hallucinations, deep fakes
            and more, which have also begun to exhibit exponential characteristics. It is hence crucial to develop
            systems that amplify the gains and minimize the loss, thereby creating a net positive exponential. I refer
            to this net difference as the <strong>"Exponential Delta."</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Exponential Delta = Exponential Gains minus Exponential Loss</strong>

        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Societal Benefit’ occurs when Exponential Delta is positive
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Societal Harm’ occurs when Exponential Delta is negative
        </p>

        <p>
            We, at <strong><span class="underline blue">Apurva.ai</span></strong>, acknowledge our responsibility to develop systems that generate a positive "Exponential
            Delta" for the society. To accomplish this objective, we are establishing an array of capabilities,
            including:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Trust</strong> - Ensuring that the knowledge and insights generated originate from sources we trust, rather than the
            internet.
        </p>
        <p>
           <srrong>Provenance</srrong> - Maintaining traceability to the sources of knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Telemetric governance - Providing transparency and a better understanding of the interactions that happen on
            the platform.

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Feedback Loops</strong> - Establishing a process of continuous learning and improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Credentialed users</strong> - Granting access to qualified and trustworthy users.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Bias Mitigation</strong> - Incorporating diverse sources and strategies to prevent bias.
        </p>
        <p>
            By fostering a culture of openness and promoting collective wisdom, we believe that the true benefit of
            these capabilities can be realized. This involves recognizing inequalities and embracing diversity to create
            a platform that is truly mutual.
