      "apurvaExplainsContent": "Collective Wisdom is when individuals or groups from different segments of society come together to solve a complex systems problem.

They don't always lean on a central authority or organization or coordination, but rather, they harness the collective strength of their members. It's a testament to the power of community and shared resources."
