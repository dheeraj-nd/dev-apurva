        <p style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;"> Building beyond the invention and reinvention of the wheel
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Working on sustainable solutions, SELCO Foundation is a powerhouse that democratises the delivery of health,
            education and livelihoods with sustainable energy as a catalyst. With its roots grounded in multiple
            domains, the foundation has various teams working on these sustainable solutions. Thus, conversations are an
            integral structure, to encourage teams to work and learn from each other. 
        </p>

        <p>
            But this can prove to be a challenge, especially with teams working in silos on overlapping problems and
            devising similar solutions from scratch. SELCO Foundation’s pace for problem solving and strategic planning
            was slowed with limited space to cross learn between teams and build on each other’s learnings. More time
            and capital were instead spent to reinvent the wheel in various ways. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Fast forward to Apurva.ai in the picture, powering SELCO Foundation, where teams are able to seamlessly
            retain and work towards allied solutions for their overlapping problem solving from their conversations. The
            repeated reinvention of the wheel is being reduced with the platform, making way for better development and
            impact. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Here is the transformational journey of SELCO Foundation with Apurva.ai, put together from conversations
            with<br>
            <strong>Harish Hande, Co-founder, Rachita Misra, Associate Director - Knowledge and Advocacy and Simrin

            , of how SELCO Foundation broke the cycle of reinvention by adopting Apurva.ai!

                    <br>
                    Bringing together different perspectives and conversations across teams and domains is
                    one of the sweet spots of Apurva.ai, thus incorporating the platform into the workings of SELCO
                    Foundation
                    was seamless. Engaging with the product line, Power of Co-creation, the organisation was awed by the
                    emergence of collective wisdom from conversations between various teams and collaborators. <br>

                        Apurva.ai joins and participates in conversations, both online and offline, to
                        co-create knowledge. The platform listens and adds to the discussion and provides perspectives,
                        sentiments,
                        ideas and call-to-actions at the end. The knowledge co-created can be queried during and post
                        the
                        conversations. The emerging collective wisdom is added to the ever-growing Apurva’s digital
                        brain.

        <p class="d-sm-block d-md-none">But what does
            Apurva.ai do in these conversations? The platform steers conversations in a more</p>
        <p>
            effective manner, exploring new possibilities which people may or may not be thinking during conversations
            from different perspectives of the ecosystem. These are done with questions and prompts, which help in
            designing solutions and programs based on the emerging collective wisdom. The platform keeps a consented
            record of these conversations, amassed across time and themes. SELCO Foundation was able to access the
            insights from these conversations despite changes in systems and people, and thereby reducing the cost of
            learning, meetings and implementation. 

        </p>

        <p>
            Simrin Chhachhi, Senior Research Manager, described how SELCO Foundation as an ecosystem builder would like
            to present the knowledge they have curated to the world. But before that is done, the knowledge has to be
            organised and synthesised within the organisation. With Apurva.ai this is possible. Chhachhi says “Apurva.ai
            is like a buddy present, pushing us towards comprehensive conversations, which is the core of what we do. It
            offers more systemic thinking questions and inputs in real time conversations, more than I was able to.”

        </p>
        <p>
            The collective wisdom curated within Apurva’s digital brain provides insights beyond the whats, whys and
            hows. In the words of Rachita Misra, Associate Director - Knowledge and Advocacy, it enables one to “achieve
            something more nuanced based on experiences, based on interacting with divergent views, and based on the
            instinct that has been developed.” The collective wisdom unearthed here includes diverse perspectives of
            different people, from the sector, community and the network. Misra adds how the multilingual feature opens
            access to more voices to provide answers from the ecosystem. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, accessing collective wisdom is made easier even with a set of loosely connected keywords while
            querying. Apurva.ai is able to understand the context of the question even without exact terms and provide
            relevant answers based on the curated knowledge.

        </p>
        <p>
            Misra claims that she gets very excited when exploring the knowledge of ‘hows’ over whats and whys,
            especially aided by the prompt questions by Apurva.ai. She says that by asking how, one can understand
            strategies present across sectors, leading to better questions and consecutively, to better solutions. 

        </p>
        <p>
            But what is the relevance of questions? Chhachhi, in reply to her views on before and after Apurva.ai,
            provided a significant perspective. She said that the SELCO Foundation had a lot of answers and only a
            couple of questions before. Now, they have more pointed questions. When questioned why ‘more questions’ are
            considered a positive step, Chhachhi said, “for me, analysis comes from asking the right questions.” As we
            say in Apurva.ai, right questions are half the solutions. Understanding questions and how problem statements
            are framed is essential before taking a stab at feasible solutions, else there are possibilities of
            problem-solution misfits. 

        </p>
        <p> <strong> SELCO X Apurva.ai</strong></p>

        <p>
            By offering Apurva.ai a seat at the table, teams in SELCO Foundation are, instead of reinventing the wheel,
            building on each other’s work, faster and more efficiently. When asked about the journey of SELCO Foundation
            and Apurva.ai, Harish Hande, Co-founder, simply said “transformational”. He commented how the three major
            stakeholders of Samaj, Bazaar and Sarkar (Society, Market and Government), which have very few connections
            and loopbacks of solutions, powered by Apurva.ai can lead to better sustainable approaches and holistic
            societies. Now, systemic changes can be envisioned which cut across vertically, horizontally and diagonally
            through regions and socio-economic strata. He wishes to use SELCO’s experience with Apurva.ai as a needle
            mover in the development sector. 

        </p>
        <p>Apurva.ai, as described by SELCO Foundation, is a one stop knowledge centre for the development sector,
            blurring the boundaries between stakeholders, domains and countries. The team from SELCO Foundation engaging
            with Apurva.ai are thrilled with the innumerable possibilities, in both the present and future, where
            inclusive participation of teams lead to co-created approaches and solutions.</p>
