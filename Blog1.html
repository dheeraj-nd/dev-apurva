        <p class="Centered">BY <strong><span class="blue">@ANAND RAJAN</span></strong> | 2MIN READ | PUBLISHED ON 26.04.2023</p>
        <p>As I eased into my seat on a recent flight from Bangalore to Hyderabad, I couldn't help but overhear an
            interesting discussion between my two fellow passengers regarding ChatGPT. Despite their divergent
            viewpoints, they concurred on ChatGPT’s overarching utility and how it has completely changed the way
            they accessed knowledge. Preferring not to intervene, I took on the role of a silent observer, entranced
            by their dialogue.</p>

        <p>
            This, however, prompted me to ponder about <a href="" class="underline">#generativeai</a> , the revolutionary technology that drives
            ChatGPT, BARD, and numerous other products and platforms, and the level of pervasiveness it has brought
            about. Many experts believe that, if appropriately designed and regulated, this technology has the
            potential to be transformational, on par with the likes of Electricity and the Internet. But what sets
            it apart? Despite AI having been around for decades, steadily evolving, what caused the sudden
            exponential upswing in the last few years?
        </p>

        <div class="image_rectangle">

        <p>
            While the cumulative impact of advancements has certainly contributed, I contend that the more influential
            factor has been the introduction of a novel architecture model known as "Transformers". This breakthrough
            has endowed Generative AI with the capability to assimilate information at an unparalleled magnitude and
            velocity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Powered by a foundational Neural Network, these models now have the potential to establish a "Network of
            Knowledge" on an internet- scale, transforming the way we access and process information.
        </p>
        <p>

            But how does all of this relate to <span class="underline">#changeleaders?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Societal problems can often seem like a tangled knot, with multiple stakeholders, perspectives, and causes
            making it arduous to uncover a solution. To tackle these intricate problems, several valuable Systems Change
            frameworks have arisen. One shared trait among these approaches is the imperative to perceive the system
            holistically, as a web of interconnected and interacting entities striving towards a shared objective.

        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, putting this idea into practice is easier said than done. It requires collaboration across
            diverse minds, a willingness to embrace complexity, and the ability to harness the <strong>"Knowledge of their
            Network" </strong>and transform it into actionable insights and wisdom.

        </p>
        <div class="image_rectangle">

        </div>

        <p>
            Generative technologies that enable a <strong>"Network of Knowledge"</strong> can assist Change Leaders in their endeavor to
            harness the <strong>“Knowledge of their Network”</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This inspired us to develop Apurva.ai, an open innovation platform for Change Leaders to harness the
            collective wisdom of their networks.

        <p>

            Although exponential technologies offer great potential for solving societal problems, one must exercise
            prudence when designing such systems to make sure they are enabling (not controlling) and help restore the
            agency of the overall system.

        <p>
            At Apurva.ai, we strive to address critical questions such as how to design systems for emergence, make them
            inclusive, govern them, and ensure their trustworthiness.
