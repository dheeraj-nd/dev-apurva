        <p>BY @ANAND RAJAN | 2MIN READ | PUBLISHED ON 26.04.2023</p>
        <p>As I eased into my seat on a recent flight from Bangalore to Hyderabad, I couldn't help but overhear an
            interesting discussion between my two fellow passengers regarding ChatGPT. Despite their divergent
            viewpoints, they concurred on ChatGPTâ€™s overarching utility and how it has completely changed the way
            they accessed knowledge. Preferring not to intervene, I took on the role of a silent observer, entranced
            by their dialogue.</p>

        <p>
            This, however, prompted me to ponder about #generativeai , the revolutionary technology that drives
            ChatGPT, BARD, and numerous other products and platforms, and the level of pervasiveness it has brought
            about. Many experts believe that, if appropriately designed and regulated, this technology has the
            potential to be transformational, on par with the likes of Electricity and the Internet. But what sets
            it apart? Despite AI having been around for decades, steadily evolving, what caused the sudden
            exponential upswing in the last few years?
